THE DRIVER THEN SECURED THE DEFECTIVE DRUM IN THE TRUCK  SPREAD SODA ASH AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM TO ABSORB AND NEUTRALIZE ANY ACID THAT MIGHT ESCAPE FROM THE CRACK DUE TO JOSTLING DURING TRANSPORTATION.

(DRUMS ON PALLETS ARE BANDED TOGETHER FOR STABILITY.  IF THE DRUMS  REPEATEDLY  WERE BANDED TO TIGHTLY TO ALLOW FOR PRODUCT EXPANSION DUE TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES  INTERNAL PRESSURE MAY HAVE WEAKENED THE SEAMS). RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE HANDLING: 1) REMOVE OLDER DRUMS FROM SERVICE  2) INSTRUCT: A) DRUM FILLERS TO CHECK MORE CAREFULLY FOR PACKAGE INTEGRITY BEFORE FILLING  B) LOADER AND DRIVER TO CHECK CAREFULLY FOR PACKAGE INTEGRITY BEFORE LOADING  C) DRUM BANDER TO ALLOW FOR EXPANSION WHEN BANDING PALLETIZED DRUMS.,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

WASHINGTON  D.C. HAD BEGUN TO LEAK DIESEL FUEL. EMPLOYEE INDICATED THAT SHE HAD COMPLETED FUELING EQUIPMENT ON THE SITE AND LEFT HER TRUCK PARKED ON THE EASTBOUND SIDE OF VAN NESS STREET WHILE SHE WENT UP TO THE CHERRY HILL OFFICE TRAILER. SHE WAS WALKING BACK TO HER TRUCK FROM THE TRAILER AND WAS AT THE INTERSECTION OF INTERNATIONAL DRIVE AND VAN NESS WHEN SHE NOTICED THE LEAK. UPON INVESTIGATION  EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY FAILURE OF A HOSE COUPLING ON THE LINE FROM THE MAIN TANK TO THE PUMP. THE LEAK ORIGINATED AROUND THE COUPLING AND THERE WAS NOT A “HOLE” IN THE LINE IT WOULD BE BETTER DESCRIBED AS A SEPARATION OF THE METAL COUPLING FROM THE LINE. THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE RELEASE IS 8-10 MINUTES. THE ABSORBENT THAT WAS STORED ON THE FUEL TRUCK WAS DEPLOYED IMMEDIATELY.     OTHER CHERRY HILL PERSONNEL RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY TO CONTAIN THE SPILLED FUEL. ANOTHER MALE EMPLOYEE (CHERRY HILL SUPERINTENDENT) HAD THE ON-SITE SPILL KIT BROUGHT TO THE SCENE AND DEPLOYED MORE ABSORBENT AS WELL AS ABSORBENT PADS. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:40 AM MALE EMPLOYEE CALLED ME TO NOTIFY ME OF THE SPILL. I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED ME TO BRING THE SPILL KIT FROM OUR TAYLOR STREET BRIDGE PROJECT AND HE RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. I LOADED THE SPILL KIT AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE CHINA EMBASSY PROJECT. I CALLED MY SUPERVISOR (CHERRY HILL SAFETY DIRECTOR) TO NOTIFY HIM OF THE SPILL AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS ALREADY AWARE OF THE SPILL AND THAT CLEAN VENTURES (CLEAN-UP CONTRACTOR) HAD ALREADY BEEN NOTIFIED AND WAS PREPARING TO RESPOND TO THE SPILL.    AT APPROXIMATELY 12:10-12:15 PM I ARRIVED ON THE SCENE. I NOTED THE FUEL TRUCK WAS PARKED JUST EAST OF THE SITE ACCESS CLOSEST TO THE SINGAPORE EMBASSY AND A STREAM OF FUEL HAD TRAVELED FROM THE TRUCK DOWNHILL TOWARD CONNECTICUT AVENUE. I ALSO NOTED CHERRY HILL PERSONNEL SPREADING ABSORBENT IN THE INTERSECTION OF INTERNATIONAL DRIVE AND VAN NESS.     THE ABSORBENT AND PADS FROM THE SPILL KIT I BROUGHT WERE IMMEDIATELY PLACED ON THE FUEL IN THE INTERSECTION OF INTERNATIONAL DRIVE AND VAN NESS. AS THE ABSORBENT WAS BEING PLACED I HEARD SIRENS FROM DCFD EQUIPMENT.     ONCE DCFD ARRIVED I SOUGHT OUT THE INCIDENT COMMANDER (BATTALION CHIEF - NO NAME) TO NOTIFY HIM THAT DCFD SHOULD CHECK THE OUTFALL OF THE STORM SEWER FOR POSSIBLE FUEL. HE SENT DCFD PERSONNEL TO SOAPSTONE TO CHECK ON THE STATUS AND BASED UPON THE FACT THAT CHERRY HILL WAS ACTIVELY CLEANING THE SPILL AND HAD A CLEAN-UP CONTRACTOR ON THE WAY HE REMOVED THE DCFD EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL FROM THE SCENE. THE CAPT. (SOD BATTALION CHIEF) REMAINED ON THE SCENE. HE ADVISED THAT HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BATTALION THAT INCLUDES HAZMAT.

The driver had paperwork that requires the customer representative to  sign prior to off-loading that states that their storage tank has the capacity to hold the shipment. The driver's responsibility during the off-loading is with the vehicle. The consignee employee's responsibility is to monitor the storage tank level.  The storage tank is out of the drivers view so when the tank level gets to a critical point the employee is to signal to the driver to stop the off-load.  The tank overflowed because the consignee employee assigned to monitor their storage tank left the area. Liquid level in the storage tank raised to a critical point and because air pressure is used to unload the tank trailer some of that pressure pushed the level even higher and some material vented out of the tank into a containment area.
